## Abstract
Cryptocurrency markets are known for their dynamic and often turbulent nature, presenting significant challenges and opportunities for investors. This project tackles this complexity by harnessing machine learning techniques, including regression models and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to develop a sophisticated predictive model. The project includes data scraping, preprocessing, visualization, and model deployment via a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit.

## Features
- **Data Scraping**: Historical price data sourced from CoinMarketCap using a Python scraper.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data with Pandas and NumPy.
- **Visualization**: Market trends and patterns visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of regression models and LSTM networks for price prediction.
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit for real-time prediction.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Streamlit

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd crypto-price-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Data Scraping**: Use the provided scripts to scrape historical data from CoinMarketCap.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Run the preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the data.
3. **Model Training**: Train the models using the provided notebooks.
4. **Web Application**: Launch the Streamlit application to start predicting cryptocurrency prices.

## Modeling Techniques
- **Regression Models**: Includes linear regression and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) for price prediction.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: A deep learning model used to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Models are evaluated using RMSE and R-squared metrics.

## Results
The models were trained and tested on historical price data, providing insights into the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets. The LSTM model, in particular, showed promising results in predicting future price movements.

## Future Work
Future efforts will focus on enhancing feature engineering, exploring ensemble methods, optimizing model parameters, and developing real-time prediction models. Additionally, integrating external data sources such as economic indicators and geopolitical events is planned to improve the models' accuracy and reliability.
